            Iâ€™m Mina Mirzayeva, a Front-End Developer passionate about building
            modern, responsive web applications. I work mainly with React,
            TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind, combining clean code with
            thoughtful UI/UX design. My background in customer service taught me
            strong communication, problem-solving, and teamwork skills, which I
            bring to every project. I enjoy learning new technologies,
            collaborating with others, and turning ideas into functional,
            user-friendly web experiences.
